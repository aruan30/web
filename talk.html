        <!--content: parts of the piano, how it works, etc-->
        <p> 
                The piano is one of the most widely played instruments in the world. According to <a href = https://blog.ambient-mixer.com/sound/top-10-most-popular-instruments-to-play/> https://blog.ambient-mixer.com/sound/top-10-most-popular-instruments-to-play/</a>, about 21 million people in the United States play the piano! Most standard pianos have 88 keys of which 52 are white and 36 are black. The white keys are called natural keys and they represent one of 7 different notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, or B. The black keys represent flats or sharps. The pitch of the piano keys increases from left to right. The piano can be classified as part of the string family or the percussion family. Instruments in the string family produce sound when strings are plucked or striked, while instruments in the percussion family produce sound when they are hit. The piano can belong to both families because when a piano is played, tiny hammers in the piano strike strings to cause them to vibrate and produce sound.

        <h2> Famous Pianists </h2>
        
        <!--content: facts about Mozart and Beethoven, along with links to some of their pieces-->
        <p> 
            There are many brilliant pianists in history. Two of the most famous pianists and composers are Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (the first picture below from left to right) and Ludwig van Beethoven (the second picture below from left to right). Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in 1756 in Salzburg, Austria and died in 1791. He composed 41 symphonies and 25 piano concerti. Mozart was a child prodigy. His first symphony was written when he was 9 and his first opera was written when he was 11. Two of his pieces are "<a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quxTnEEETbo> Piano Sonata No. 11 </a>" (also known as "Rondo alla Turca" or "Turkish March") and "<a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hJf4ZffkoI> Symphony No. 40 </a>." Ludwig van Beethoven was born in Bonn, Germany in 1770 and he died in 1827. In his lifetime, he wrote 9 symphonies and even though he lost his hearing later on in his life, he still continued to compose music. Two of his pieces are "<a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XG3h6LywNQ> Fur Elise</a>" and "<a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3217H8JppI> Symphony No. 9 </a>."

        <h2> My Piano </h2>

        <!--content: how I started playing piano, current status, why I like playing the piano-->
        <p>
            I first came into contact with the piano in pre-k. My mother had signed me up for a class for exploring musical instruments. At first, the piano didn't catch my eye. However, later I started playing and I've been playing ever since. My first few piano classes were in a small crowded classroom in a tall building in Manhattan. Several electric keyboards were placed in rows in the room with a single keyboard in front for the teacher to demonstrate on. I enjoyed the class but I wasn't able to learn as well because I couldn't quite hear my own playing in the room. In either first or second grade, I was introduced to my current piano teacher and I started taking one-on-one classes with her. Under her instruction, I learned many new techniques and new pieces. Due to COVID-19, I have stopped taking piano classes with my teacher. However, occasionally I still practice and I plan to resume classes as soon as the coronavirus pandemic is over. I enjoy playing the piano because it is a great way to relax and bond with friends. Before Rona times, I would play pop songs on my piano while my friends sang along. I also enjoy playing and listening to classical piano pieces (PROTIP: Listen to classical music when studying. It might help you memorize and focus more). Some of my favorite piano pieces are "The Flight of the Bumblebee" by Rimsky-Korsakov, "Nocturnes, Op.9 No.2" by Frederic Chopin, "Turkish March" by Mozart, and "River Flows in You" by Yiruma. Click <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptRsnhiP1dc> here </a> to listen to a short portion of "The Flight of the Bumblebee" played by Lang Lang, a talented Chinese pianist! The piano is a wonderful instrument and I definitely recommend it to anyone that is interested in playing a instrument or just music in general to try it out. It doesn't matter how old you are, it's never too late to get started with playing the piano!
